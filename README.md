#Bioshock Physics Unlocker
Simple patcher which lets you adjust Bioshock's physics timestep.

This has been tested with the Steam release of the game, and should also work for the version 1.0 & 1.1 retail releases. I have heard that it does not work with the Direct2Drive release of the game, presumably due to some form of DRM.

##Usage
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/TurtleHx/Bioshock-Physics-Unlocker/releases/latest).
2. Extract the `BioshockPhysicsUnlocker.exe` file into your Bioshock directory, typically: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\bioshock\Builds\Release`.
3. Run the executable and enter your desired physics framerate.
